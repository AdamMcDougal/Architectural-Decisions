--- 

  

##### Authors: Adam McDougal and Rhianna Smith   

  

## Summary   

--- 

 

### Issue     

- Our team will have to decide whether we want to make our app Native, web, or a hybrid.  

  

### Decision   

- We have decided to make our app accessible through both a web browser and mobile so that we will have a wider range of customers.  

 

### Status   

- The status of this decision has been approved.  

  

### Issue    

 - A UI Framework needs to be chosen for the app.  

  

### Decision   

- React Native was chosen because it allows the creation of mobile applications that will work on multiple platforms while only using one codebase which is more efficient and suits the project's needs.  

  

### Status   

- The status of this decision has been approved.    

  

### Issue    

 - We will have to decide what backend language we want to use to best utilize our time and quality for our app.  

  

### Decision   

 - The app will be created using JavaScript language due to our decision to use React Native for our UI Framework.  

  

### Status   

- The status of this decision has been approved.  

  

### Issue    

 - Our team must discuss what permissions the app is going to require from the users.  

 

 ### Decision     

  

- Taking into consideration the requests from the company for the project the app permissions needed would be as follows:     
  - Internet access for syncing data for offline mode, having access to payment gateways and having the ability for the app to send data to the analytics servers for tracking the user behavior.  
   - Push Notification permissions to inform the user about order status updates, new product arrivals, and exclusive offers. 
    - Storage Permissions for allowing the user to browse products or view their orders in offline mode.   

  

### Status   

 - The status of this decision has been approved.  

  

### Issue    

- We must decide how we will be storing data.  

  

### Decision    

- We have chosen to use Google Firebase to accommodate the companyâ€™s requirements for image storage, image optimization and the online and offline data storage requirements. The reason we chose Google Firebase was because of its vast capabilities and developer-friendly platform.   

  

### Status   

- The status of this decision has been approved.  

 

 ### Issue    

- We will need a payment gateway to incorporate into our app.  

  

### Decision     

- We have chosen Square as our payment gateway as it is known to be one of the front runners for mobile payment systems.  Square also offers in-person payment systems so it would be convenient to have all transactions taking place through one gateway.   

  

### Status   

- The status of this decision has been approved.  

  

### Issue   

- Since the company plans to expand its business internationally the app will need to support multiple languages, adapt to cultural preferences, and implement localization techniques.  

  

### Decision    

- We have chosen to incorporate react-native-localize library to help mitigate these issues.    

  

### Status   

- The status of this decision has been approved.  

   

### Issue    

- We need a way to handle sending push notifications.  

  

### Decision    

 - Since we are already using Google Firebase, we have chosen Firebase Cloud Messaging to handle push notifications. The service is also provided at no additional cost, which is a bonus.   

  

### Status   

- The status of this decision has been approved.  

  

  ### Issue    

- We will need a way to track user behavior such as product views, purchases, and interactions with loyalty programs.  

  

### Decision    

- Since we have already decided to use Google Firebase for a lot of our other issues and because it will be able to do what we need we have chosen to use Google Analytics for Firebase to handle tracking user behavior.   

  

### Status   

- The status of this decision has been approved.   

 

### Assumptions  

--- 

 

- By choosing the Google firebase platform for most of our different issues and needs, we believe we will run into fewer issues with getting everything working together.  Using a single platform to cover our needs should make things come together more smoothly.  

 

- Soley choosing react-native-localize library to address the need of supporting multiple languages and adapting to cultural preferences to implement localization techniques will be enough to cover that issue.   

  

### Constraints    

--- 

 

- The proposed project size will be our largest to date, which will result in the need for strict time management and proper team communication.  

  

- There may be future issues with access to all Native modules, which would require time to find a solution.  

  

- The choice to use React Native to create the app was a positive decision in a programming aspect but could result in us running into issues with its security vulnerabilities. We will need to ensure our coding is secure before the release to the company, which could increase the time needed for development.  

## Notes   
---
 - A schedule will need to be created to make sure the team stays on course to meet deadlines.
